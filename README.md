## **Virtualization Use Cases**

### **Consolidation of Computing Resources**

Often times when provisioning infrastructure, underutilization of servers
is prevalent. Most applications deployed aren't taking full advantage of
all system resources availalbe. This over-provisioning can lead to
increases in costs and the overall size of the infrastructure outlay.

Cosolidating infrastructure in a unified virtualization solution can lend
to providing more flexibility, more technology choices, and keeping
software licensing costs under control. Additionally, with a unified
virtualization solution efficiencies increase in both infrastrucutre
management as well as workloads.

--------------------------------------------

### **Improving Workload Performance**

Not only are efficiencies gained, but workload performance can also
increase. Take for example a virtualization with shared virtual
storage. These virtual storage solutions can lead to significant
increases in speed and reliability for mission-critical services.

With mission-critical services, availability is top of mind.
Virtualization can offer more resiliency and up time to customers
through better replication and recovery capabilities that can
not be cost-effectively matched with bare metal servers, in most
scenarios.

Furthermore, with a cohesive virtualization solution there is
tighter control over workload placements. For example, if there
are very specific system resource requirements for certain
workloads, those workloads can then be tagged or married to
specific virtualized instances.

--------------------------------------------

### **Development and Testing Environments**

Time to market or mission is critical when developing applications
and services essential to success. To reduce that time, virtualized
environments may be provisioned to further support application
development efforts. 

Preconfigured environments for devlopment and testing purposes
reduce the friction and duration of onboarding of new developers.
It can also allow more tenured developers to create environments
quickly for feature development and experimentation that produces
shorter iterations and faster delivery of features.

--------------------------------------------

### **Hybrid Virtualized Environments**

VMs aren't the only things manageable by virtualization. In some
cases, Enterprises are combining virtual machines and containers
in the same infrastructure footprint. This means VMs and containers
alike are treated uniformly and can be allocated as needed like
any other computing resource.

--------------------------------------------

### **Specialized Virtual Workstations**

In some organizations, specialized roles exist on teams that
require special software or capabilities not normally found on
a typical workstation. Instead of purchasing expensive workstations
that rapidly depreciate, administrators provision a virtual
workstation with all the technical capabilities needed (e.g.
professional grade graphics card) for the specialized role
to effectively complete their work.

When employees enter and exit the organization it can be costly
and time consuming to reclaim physical workstations and ensure they
are properly cleaned of any prior data and reprovisioned. The
virtualization strategy is more cost effective, while maintaining
better security and tighter control and monitoring over data.
